Top machine learning algorithms:

ðŸ”¢ Supervised Learning Algorithms
Linear Regression
Predicts a continuous target variable assuming a linear relationship between inputs and output.

Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification; estimates the probability of a class using a logistic (sigmoid) function.

Decision Trees
Uses a tree-like structure to split data based on feature values for classification or regression tasks.

Random Forest
An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by averaging multiple tree outputs.

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between them.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Predicts based on the majority label (or average) of the k nearest data points in the training set.

Naive Bayes
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming feature independence.

Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Sequentially builds weak learners (usually trees) to correct errors of previous models using boosting.

ðŸ“Š Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
K-Means Clustering
Partitions data into K clusters based on feature similarity by minimizing intra-cluster variance.

Hierarchical Clustering
Builds a tree of clusters (dendrogram), suitable for visualizing nested grouping in data like gene expression.

ðŸ§  Neural Networks
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Modeled after the brain; ANNs handle general prediction tasks, while CNNs are specialized for image data.
